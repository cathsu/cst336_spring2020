            <p>Arrays are one of the most basic (and useful!) data structures.</p>
            
            <p>The image on the above right displays how arrays are declared in C. Although programming languages differ in how they declare an array, 
            the basic concept remains the same.</p>
            
            <p>An array is a group of items that are stored in contigious memory. 
            These collection of items are referenced by a single variable. 
            As this collection of items are stored right next to each other, we can quickly 
            access every item in the array. </p>
            
            <p>Let's look at the image on the above left. Think of an array like
            a flight of stairs, where every stair tread has a value and location attached to 
            it. To reference any of those values, we only have to reference 
            the location of the stair tread. </p>
